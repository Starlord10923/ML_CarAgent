# ðŸš— Unity ML-Agents â€“ Autonomous Car Simulation

This project showcases a Unity-based autonomous driving simulation using machine learning. Leveraging the Unity ML-Agents Toolkit, a car agent is trained to navigate racing tracks without human input, learning to drive through trial and error using reinforcement learning.

## ðŸ§  Project Objective

To train a virtual car to:
- Navigate complex driving tracks
- Avoid collisions and off-track movement
- Optimize its route through continuous feedback and learning

The car starts with no prior knowledge and gradually learns effective driving behavior by maximizing rewards tied to forward progress and penalizing collisions or inefficient movement.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Highlights

- Uses **machine learning agents** to simulate real-world autonomous driving behavior
- Agent improves over time by learning from its successes and mistakes
- Simulates challenges such as curves, narrow paths, and obstacles
- Demonstrates core principles of reinforcement learning in a visual, interactive way

## ðŸ“Œ Why It Matters

This simulation is a conceptual foundation for understanding how autonomous vehicles can learn to make driving decisions in real-time environments. It reflects how AI can be trained in controlled virtual spaces before being deployed in real-world applications.
